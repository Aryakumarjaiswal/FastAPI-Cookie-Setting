# FastAPI-Cookie-Setting
Imagine you walk into a library and ask for a book. The librarian gives you the book AND a small token (cookie) with your name on it.

The next time you visit, you show this token.
The librarian remembers you and quickly finds your books without asking for your name again.
In web development, a cookie is like that token. It is a small piece of data stored in your web browser that helps websites remember you.


In the chat system we discussed:

Session ID is created (/session/ endpoint)

When a new user starts a chat, we create a unique session ID and store it in a cookie.
